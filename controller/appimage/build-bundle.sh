# Headless SAINT Controller AppImage builder.
#
# Produces a .AppImage from the Tauri project, stages it into the
# server's firmware resources tree, and regenerates info.json.
# Designed to be invoked from two places without modification:
#
#   1. Inside the linux/amd64 Docker container built from
#      controller/appimage/Dockerfile, driven by build-docker.sh on a
#      developer machine (Apple Silicon Mac via Rosetta, Linux native,
#      whatever).
#   2. Directly on a GitHub Linux runner (amd64 native, no Docker),
#      driven by the appimage-controller job in .github/workflows/dist.yml.
#
# Everything is parameterized via env vars so the same script handles
# both. Defaults assume the Docker layout; CI overrides.
#
#   REPO_ROOT     repo checkout root              (default /work)
#   BUILD_DIR     persistent cache root           (default /build)
#                 holds cargo registry, target/, node_modules, npm cache
#
# Output:
#   $REPO_ROOT/server/resources/firmware/controller/saint_firmware_controller_<v>-local.<sha>.AppImage
#   $REPO_ROOT/server/resources/firmware/controller/info.json
#
# This replaces controller/flatpak/build-bundle.sh; see
# controller/docs/APPIMAGE_MIGRATION.md for the migration rationale.
