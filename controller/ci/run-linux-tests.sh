# Run the controller's Rust test suite inside a Linux container.
#
# Why: parts of the controller (the Steam Deck HID parser in
# src/input/steamdeck_hid.rs) are #[cfg(target_os = "linux")], so they
# don't compile — and their tests don't run — on a macOS/Windows dev box.
# This builds the Linux toolchain image and runs `cargo test` in it, so
# those tests are exercised everywhere. CI calls the same script
# (.github/workflows/controller-tests.yml) so local and CI stay in lockstep.
#
# Usage (from anywhere):
#   controller/ci/run-linux-tests.sh                # full lib test suite
#   controller/ci/run-linux-tests.sh steamdeck_hid  # just the HID parser
#
# Any args are passed through as a cargo test filter.
