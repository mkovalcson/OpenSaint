//! mDNS / DNS-SD discovery for SAINT.OS servers.
//!
//! The Steam Deck (and any vanilla Linux without libnss-mdns + a
//! configured systemd-resolved) can't resolve `*.local` hostnames
//! through the OS resolver. Since the controller binary talks to the
//! server over WebSocket, that means a Steam Deck operator can't
//! connect by hostname — only by IP. We can't ship libnss-mdns "in the
//! app," and SteamOS's read-only root makes installing it manually
//! awkward. So we run our own pure-Rust mDNS client INSIDE the
//! controller and bypass the OS resolver entirely.
//!
//! This module provides two capabilities:
//!
//!   1. `resolve_local_hostname(host, timeout)` — one-shot mDNS A
//!      lookup. Used inline by the connect path so an operator who
//!      types `opensaint.local` gets transparent resolution before the
//!      WebSocket library calls getaddrinfo.
//!
//!   2. `DiscoveryService` — a background browser for
//!      `_http._tcp.local.` services. The SAINT.OS server advertises
//!      itself via avahi at install time (see
//!      `.github/dist/install.sh` `setup_mdns`), so the controller
//!      sees every reachable robot and can show the operator a
//!      dropdown instead of asking them to type a hostname.
//!
//! Both paths use multicast UDP on `224.0.0.251:5353` (and the v6
//! equivalent), opened from inside the controller process. No system
//! package, no config file edit, no read-only filesystem dance.
