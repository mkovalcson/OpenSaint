/**
 * Vue Router config. Routes mirror the Angular app.routes.ts.
 * Components are loaded eagerly for the Controller/Settings paths
 * (the operator hits these from boot) and lazily for Bindings
 * (heavy form UI, only opened when actively editing).
 *
 * Hash history is used because Tauri serves the built bundle from a
 * non-HTTP scheme where path-based history fights with the webview's
 * URL handling.
